## Introduction

This game is designed for football lovers. The focus of this game is to build your knowledge about football and to test the players knowledge about the history of this sport including information about the players, goals and won games.
This game consists of ten multiple choice questions with a choice of four answers. The purpose of the site is to test your knowledge and to learn some new facts about football.
This is my second project out of five milestones projects which students are required to complete in this full stack software development course from Code Institute.
The main programming language I used for this project is HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. It was essential to ensure that this site was responsive on all the devices.

## Target
* On every game page I added a background of a football pitch with a goal post, I did this so users can easily understand this game is about football players or football history. 
* I added a score tracker for each question. When a player plays this game, he can see the right or wrong answer before the final result. This encourages players finish the game to see their final result. 

#### Skeleton
* I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/3CPjEZJrlwFCZhLZUp3eRe/javascript-p2?node-id=0%3A1) Wireframe to attach the following pages:
